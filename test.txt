Tableau can be used to analyze the "TFL Bus Safety" dataset, which includes 
information about bus incidents. We can create a bar chart to visualize incident counts 
by borough and a line chart to observe trends in incidents over time. Formatting the 
x-axis to display the first letter of each month enhances readability. Additionally, 
treemaps can help explore data fields, excluding date and year, to understand 
proportions and relationships. An interactive dashboard combines these visualizations 
for a comprehensive view of the data. Using Tableau, we can gain insights into bus 
safety trends and develop data analysis skills.

Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that can be used to analyze large 
datasets. It can help you to visualize the data in a way that is easy to understand and 
interpret. Tableau can be used to create a variety of visualizations, including 
choropleth maps, line charts, bar charts, and donut charts. These visualizations can 
help you to identify trends and patterns in the data, which can then be used to make 
informed decisions about your business.  
Tableau can be used to answer many questions about your sales data. For 
example, it can help you to identify which state has the highest revenue, how revenue 
changes over time, how revenue differs by age group, and what the percentage of 
revenue is by region. It is a powerful tool that can help you to gain insights into your 
sales data and make informed decisions about your business.
